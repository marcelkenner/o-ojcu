Before finishing a task:
- Run `npm run lint` (source nvm first); ensure it passes.
- Confirm anchors and routes still match src/lib/routes.ts.
- Update docs/website_repro_playbook.md if processes, commands, or structure change.
- Keep new files under 300 lines; split if larger.
- Ensure sitemap/robots/metadata reflect any route changes.
