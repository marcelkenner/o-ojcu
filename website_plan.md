Comprehensive Website Plan for the Book “O ojcu, który nigdy nim nie był”

This document provides a detailed A–Z plan for designing, structuring and optimizing a marketing site for the non‑fiction book O ojcu, który nigdy nim nie był (Intymna opowieść o polskim ojcostwie i jego braku). The goal is to create a site that is emotionally compelling, easy to navigate and highly optimized for search engines (SEO) and conversions.

1 Site Purpose and Goals

Primary objective: promote the book and convert visitors into purchasers and subscribers. The site should evoke the emotional themes of the memoir, answer visitors’ questions, allow them to download a free sample (Prolog + night-with‑police scene) and link to retailers.

Secondary objective: build the author’s brand and capture leads via a newsletter. The newsletter will provide updates and future projects, driving long‑term engagement.

Audience: Polish‑speaking readers who grew up with absent or emotionally unavailable fathers (primary), plus relatives, therapists and anyone interested in memoirs on Polish fatherhood.

2 Site Architecture and Pages

Although the core of the site will be a long‑scrolling one‑page design with anchor links, multiple subpages are necessary for SEO and legal compliance. A summary of the pages/subpages:

Page / Subpage	Purpose & Content	Notes
Home page	One‑page layout with sections (Hero, For whom, About, Excerpt, What’s inside, Author, Testimonials, Where to buy, FAQ, Newsletter, Footer). Each section uses clear headings and internal anchors.	Primary page for SEO and conversions.
Privacy Policy	Details of data collection (cookies, analytics), newsletter consent, third‑party scripts.	Comply with GDPR and other regulations.
Newsletter Terms	Explanation of how email addresses are used, data protection measures, opt‑out instructions.	Separate from privacy policy; fosters transparency.
Other bookstores	Optional page listing all retailers and bookstore locations.	Improves internal linking and captures “where to buy” queries.
Blog/Articles	Optional section with posts on themes like Polish fatherhood, memoir writing, coping with trauma.	Supports SEO by capturing long‑tail informational queries and building topical authority

3 Visual Design and Branding
3.1 Color and Theme

Palette: choose 2‑5 primary colors with strong contrast
webstacks.com
. A muted background (e.g., off‑white or light gray) paired with deep accent colors (navy, burgundy or dark green) reflects the seriousness of the subject. Use a contrasting accent color (e.g., burnt orange) for call‑to‑action buttons to stand out against the main palette.

Contrast: maintain a minimum contrast ratio of 4.5:1 for normal text and 3:1 for large headings to ensure readability
webstacks.com
. Dark text on light backgrounds (or vice versa) helps users with low vision and aligns with Web Content Accessibility Guidelines.

Imagery: the book cover is the focal visual element. Use additional photographs sparingly (e.g., a blurred factory background or childhood street) to enhance mood without distracting from the copy. All images must include descriptive alt text for screen readers and SEO.

3.2 Typography

Font family: select legible, web‑safe sans‑serif fonts (e.g., Inter, Lato or Montserrat) for body text and a contrasting serif or display font for headings. Avoid overly stylized fonts.

Size and readability: set body text at a minimum of 16 px with 1.5× line height
webstacks.com
. Use clear typographic hierarchy: H1 for the main title, H2 for section titles, and H3/H4 for subsections. Consistent use of font sizes and weights supports readability and establishes visual hierarchy
ruttl.com
.

3.3 Spacing and Grid

Grid system: implement a 4‑point grid and consistent margins (16 px) for mobile and responsive layouts
webstacks.com
. Maintain generous whitespace around elements to avoid clutter and focus attention on key messages
ruttl.com
.

Alignment: follow standard reading patterns; place critical content near the top left and center of the viewport
ruttl.com
. Align CTAs and key elements consistently to guide the user through the sections.

3.4 Mobile‑First Design

Mobile-first: design for small screens first, then scale up
ruttl.com
. Over 55 % of global web traffic comes from mobile devices, and users abandon sites that load slowly or display poorly on mobile
webstacks.com
. A mobile‑first approach forces prioritization of essential elements and ensures good performance.

Responsive layouts: use CSS media queries to adjust layouts at breakpoints; maintain fluid grids and flexible images
webstacks.com
. Avoid fixed widths; use relative units like percentages and viewport width.

Touch-friendly: interactive elements (buttons, forms, accordions) must have targets at least 44×44 px with adequate spacing to prevent accidental taps
webstacks.com
. Provide visual feedback on taps (e.g., color change or ripple effect).

Performance optimization: compress images, implement lazy loading for below‑the‑fold content, minimize third‑party scripts and enable browser caching
webstacks.com
. Mobile users expect quick access; a one‑second delay can reduce conversions by up to 27 %
roiamplified.com
.

3.5 Accessibility and Inclusion

WCAG compliance: design the site to be perceivable, operable, understandable and robust
ruttl.com
. Provide alternative text for images, ensure keyboard navigation works across interactive elements, and use ARIA attributes for accordions and forms. Avoid relying solely on color to convey meaning; pair color cues with icons or text.

4 Detailed Page and Section Layouts
4.1 Home Page Overview

The home page is a long‑scrolling one‑pager with anchor links for each section. Navigation links in the header scroll smoothly to the corresponding section. A sticky navigation bar remains visible as users scroll (on mobile, collapsed into a hamburger menu). The home page structure:

Header

Logo (book title or wordmark) linking to the top of the page.

Navigation menu with anchor links: O książce, Dla kogo, Fragment, W środku, O autorze, Rekomendacje, Gdzie kupić, FAQ, Kontakt.

Primary CTA button (“Pobierz darmowy fragment” – Download sample) for immediate action. Only one primary CTA here to avoid choice paralysis
prismic.io
.

Hero Section

Headline (H1): Bold statement summarizing the book’s core theme (“O ojcu, który nigdy nim nie był” – A father who never really was).

Subheading (H2): Short promise focusing on the benefit to the reader (“Intymna opowieść o polskim ojcostwie i jego braku”). Best practices suggest leading with benefits rather than features
prismic.io
.

Supporting text: Two‑ or three‑sentence lead summarizing the emotional journey. Keep paragraphs short to enhance readability.

Primary CTA button: “Pobierz darmowy fragment” (download free sample). Use high‑contrast color and action‑oriented language
roiamplified.com
. The button should be prominent, above the fold, and evoke urgency but not pressure (“free” reduces friction).

Secondary CTA (less prominent): “Zobacz, gdzie kupić” linking to the Where to buy section. According to design guidelines, secondary CTAs should be visually subdued so they don’t compete with the primary goal
prismic.io
.

Book cover: Large image of the book on the right side (on desktop) or stacked below text (on mobile). Include a small badge like “Premiera 20XX” for social proof.

“Dla kogo jest ta książka?” (For Whom)

Heading (H2).

Intro paragraph explaining that the book is not an attack but a comfort for those who feel unseen. Use emotionally resonant language.

Bullet columns: List scenarios with which the target audience can identify (e.g., “dorastałeś z ojcem, którego wszyscy nazywali porządnym człowiekiem, a Ty bałeś się jego powrotu z pracy”). Organize into 2–3 columns for desktop; stack vertically on mobile.

SEO: Incorporate keywords like “dorosłe dzieci trudnych ojców”, “polskie ojcostwo”, “książka o ojcu alkoholiku” naturally within the list to rank for relevant queries.

“O książce” (About the Book)

Heading (H2).

Paragraphs: Describe the memoir’s genre (non‑fiction, personal essays), narrative style (non‑linear mosaic) and central themes (poverty, violence, immigration). Use clear, conversational tone.

Fact box: A smaller column lists details like language, number of pages, publisher, year of publication, with schema.org/Book markup. Structured data helps search engines show rich snippets
siteimprove.com
.

“Fragment / scena” (Excerpt)

Heading (H2).

Intro: Brief context about the scene (night in a foreign country, fear of calling the police).

Excerpt text: 2–4 paragraphs of the scene. Use italics or a visually distinct box to separate it from other content.

CTA buttons: Primary – “Pobierz darmowy fragment w PDF”; Secondary – “Zobacz, gdzie kupić”. Provide microcopy below (“Darmowy fragment obejmuje Prolog i pełną scenę nocy z policją.”).

“Co znajdziesz w środku?” (What’s inside)

Heading (H2).

Intro: Emphasize that the book is thematic, not chronological. Introduce the four parts.

Cards / Panels: Four equally spaced cards, each representing a part (I–IV) with a brief description. Use consistent design and icons to visualize the theme.

“Dlaczego ją napisałem(am)” / “O autorze” (Author)

Heading (H2).

Author photo: Left side (or above on mobile). Use high‑resolution image with alt text.

Narrative: The author’s motivations: childhood experiences, desire to give voice to others, promise of honesty without sentimentalism. Conclude with a short bio including profession and other works.

“Wasze głosy / rekomendacje” (Testimonials)

Heading (H2).

Quotes: 2–4 cards featuring blurbs from early readers or influencers. Each should include a name, age/profession (if permitted) and quote.

Social proof: This section builds trust; 98 % of people are more likely to buy if others recommend the product
roiamplified.com
.

“Gdzie kupić” (Where to Buy)

Heading (H2).

Intro: Brief text explaining the book is available in major online and brick‑and‑mortar bookstores.

Retailer cards: Each card shows the logo of a retailer (Empik, Tania Książka, publisher’s store, etc.) and a CTA button (“Kup w Empiku”). Use affiliate/UTM parameters to track conversions. These external links should open in a new tab with rel="noopener noreferrer" for security.

FAQ

Heading (H2).

Accordion list: Use an accessible accordion pattern (ARIA roles) for questions such as “Czy muszę mieć trudnego ojca, żeby ta książka mnie poruszyła?”. Expand/collapse on click; ensure keyboard accessibility.

Schema markup: Implement FAQPage structured data to help search engines display questions in rich results.

Newsletter / Darmowy Fragment

Heading (H2).

Value proposition: Explain that subscribers receive a free PDF containing the prolog and the night‑with‑police scene, plus occasional updates and event information.

Form: One required field (email), optional name field. Keep the form minimal to reduce abandonment; mobile guidelines recommend minimizing required fields and using appropriate input types

Footer

Copyright and attribution: “© 20XX [Author Name] – autor ‘O ojcu, który nigdy nim nie był’”. Dynamically update the year.

Contact: Provide an email link (e.g., mailto:kontakt@twojadomena.pl) and social media handles (Instagram, TikTok). Make them accessible via icons with text labels.

Legal links: “Polityka prywatności”, “Regulamin newslettera”, and optionally “Cookies”. Also include “Inne księgarnie” if that page exists.

5 Search Engine Optimization (SEO)
5.1 Keyword Strategy

Topical authority: Build a content hub around Polish fatherhood, memoirs, trauma and healing. Using the Corpus of Content model, focus on a limited set of topical pillars and create supporting pages/posts
firstpagesage.com
. This helps search engines see the site as a niche authority.

Long‑tail keywords: Target high‑intent, specific phrases (e.g., “książka o trudnych ojcach”, “intymna opowieść o polskim ojcostwie”) to attract qualified visitors. Conversion‑focused SEO emphasizes high‑intent keywords over high‑volume ones
roiamplified.com
.

Search intent matching: Ensure each section answers a distinct question—informational (What is the book about?), navigational (Where can I buy it?) and transactional (Download sample, subscribe). Matching page types to search intent improves conversions
firstpagesage.com
.

5.2 On‑Page SEO

Title tag: Set the <title> element to “O ojcu, który nigdy nim nie był – intymna opowieść o polskim ojcostwie”. Keep it under 60 characters and include the primary keyword.

Meta description: Write a compelling description (~150 characters) summarizing the book and including target keywords, e.g., “Dorosłe dzieci polskich ojców znajdą w tej książce emocjonalną opowieść o braku ojcostwa. Pobierz darmowy fragment i dowiedz się, gdzie kupić książkę.”

Headings: Use a logical hierarchy (H1–H4). Only one H1 per page; H2s for each section; H3s for subpoints. This improves crawlability and readability
siteimprove.com
.

URL structure: If separate pages exist, use short, descriptive URLs like /o-ksiazce, /fragment, /faq, /polityka-prywatnosci. Avoid stop words and include relevant keywords.

Internal linking: Link anchor text naturally between sections and from blog posts to relevant sections (e.g., linking a blog post on “emocjonalnie nieobecny ojciec” back to the For whom section). This helps distribute page authority and signals topical relationships
siteimprove.com
.

Image optimization: Use descriptive file names (e.g., okladka-ksiazki.jpg), alt text and compressed formats (WebP or optimized JPEG). Implement lazy loading to improve performance
webstacks.com
.

Structured data:

Book schema (schema.org/Book): Provide name, author, publisher, datePublished, isbn, description and image properties.

BreadcrumbList: Indicate hierarchical relationships if multiple pages exist.

FAQPage: Mark up FAQ content to qualify for rich snippets.

5.3 Technical SEO

Mobile-first indexing: Ensure the mobile version of the site contains all content and metadata, as Google primarily uses it for indexing and ranking
webstacks.com
.

Site speed: Optimize performance through image compression, minification of CSS/JS, caching, and limited use of third‑party scripts
webstacks.com
. A one‑second delay in page load can significantly reduce conversions and search rankings
roiamplified.com
.

HTTPS: The entire site must be served over HTTPS. Secure connections are an SEO ranking factor and build user trust
roiamplified.com
.

Core Web Vitals: Monitor metrics such as Largest Contentful Paint (LCP), First Input Delay (FID) and Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS). Use Google PageSpeed Insights to diagnose issues. Aim for sub‑3‑second LCP and minimal layout shift.

Crawlability: Use robots.txt to allow search engines to crawl necessary pages. Provide XML sitemaps listing all public pages. Avoid duplicate content; implement canonical tags if necessary.

5.4 Off‑Page SEO and Content Strategy

Backlinks: Reach out to relevant blogs, literary review sites and news outlets for reviews or guest posts. High‑quality backlinks remain one of the strongest ranking factors
siteimprove.com
.

Social media amplification: Share excerpts, behind‑the‑scenes content and testimonials across Instagram and TikTok; link back to the site.

Blog content: Publish articles related to fatherhood, memoir writing and healing. Each post should target a specific long‑tail keyword and link back to sections of the site, building internal linking and topical authority.

6 Functionality and Interactive Features
6.1 Forms and Lead Capture

Newsletter opt‑in: Implement a double opt‑in workflow for compliance. Use a reputable email marketing service (e.g., Mailchimp, GetResponse). Keep form fields minimal; mobile guidelines emphasize minimizing required fields and using appropriate input types to improve completion rates
webstacks.com
. Provide real‑time validation and clear error messages.

Download gate: Provide the free PDF sample either behind the newsletter sign‑up or as a direct link in the hero section. If gating, deliver the link via email after confirmation.

Contact form (optional): Allow visitors to contact the author or publisher. Include fields for name, email and message. Use spam protection (CAPTCHA or honeypot). Provide expected response times.

6.2 Outbound Retailer Links

Use buttons with logos to send visitors to external bookstores. Set target="_blank" and rel="noopener noreferrer" for security. Add tracking parameters (UTM codes) to monitor which retailer links convert.

Provide a disclaimer that purchases occur on the retailer’s site (e.g., Tania Książka) and that you do not process payments. This builds transparency.

6.3 Testimonials and Social Proof

Content Management: Store testimonials in a CMS to allow easy updates. Encourage early readers to leave reviews on Goodreads, Empik and social media; with permission, incorporate them into the site.

Trust badges: Consider displaying logos of major retailers or awards to reinforce credibility
roiamplified.com

6.5 Compliance and Legal Features

Cookie consent: Implement a GDPR-compliant cookie banner to inform users about cookies and analytics tracking. Provide options to accept or configure preferences.

Accessibility: Ensure keyboard navigability, screen‑reader labels, ARIA roles for interactive components and appropriate focus management.

Security: Serve the site via HTTPS; keep CMS, plugins and dependencies updated; implement Content Security Policy (CSP) headers to mitigate cross‑site scripting (XSS).

7 Ongoing Optimization and Maintenance

Content updates: Regularly update the site with new testimonials, blog posts, events and awards. Search engines favor frequently updated, informative pages
firstpagesage.com
.

Performance monitoring: Use automated tools to watch Core Web Vitals; adjust code as necessary (e.g., compress images, reduce script payload). Minify CSS/JS, use CDNs and enable HTTP/2 or HTTP/3.

Keyword monitoring: Review keyword rankings and adjust content accordingly. Expand the blog or resource sections as new search trends emerge.

User feedback: Collect feedback via surveys or session recordings to refine the user experience. Address reported bugs promptly.
